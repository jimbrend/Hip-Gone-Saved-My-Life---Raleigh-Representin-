My thoughts on Universal Remotes
gay

My thoughts on Marvel Heroes the newly released game, I don't much like it, I find it too convuluted, too many heroes and too much going on, I find that when there's too many particles
on a screen, our minds get addicted, it's fun, but it's too much.  In my honest opinion, correlation there...

Don't ya fuckn' think?
  
Cool Game, not my cup of tea.

Multi-Platform Compatibility:
Windows - Controllers, third party is not as good as.. hmmm
//third party correlations and thoughts on how they affect/effect same fuckn' difference whatever the fuck
//third party stuff is worse
Mac - Controller compatibility issue.
hmm...

//Marvel Heroes characters all suck, it's like a stupid copy-pasta of Overwatch and I find it a little off.  Very off.

What I prefer, is an action RPG RPG, but the
// rpg is being capitalized.

// the last rpg is underlined as mispelling but the operating system just can't tell if I am or am not spelling correctly, and I know I'm a good fucking speller, this fingahs just fire laugh-
out loud. hmm...
RPG = Role Playing Game
ARPG is an Action Role Playing Game
MOBA is an acronym for < ugh, Massively Online Battle Arena or some shit, League of Legends is kind of stupid don't ya think? lmfao.
FPS = ugh, < First Person Shooter
Battle Royale, oh that one? We fuckn' know.
BR.
Gaming is a beautiful mix of art and engineering...

Line ONE:




9 lines line 42.
Also spelled as, FORTY-TWO, lmfao.

// 49 = 10 so 10 lines = 9
weird. 
// Cash me outside.

Comment this shit down here...
A weird appereance of links on screen, possibly more idiots.  In my honest opinion, passion leads to struggle, but struggle is a perception based on how much you care deeply about something,
Moreso, a good leader of any organization, or Company:
They would care more, and do more, and go farther.  They would show their passion, and their anger, to achieve a goal.  If they believe that it is important.
